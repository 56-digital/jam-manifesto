  'attenuator': 'A volume knob for signals. It reduces the strength of a signal without changing its character, like turning down the brightness of a light.',

  'karlheinz stockhausen': 'A German composer who worked in the 1950s-60s pioneering electronic music. He was one of the first to treat sound itself as a material you could shape and sculpt.',

  'daphne oram': 'A British composer and inventor who built machines to turn drawings into sound. She left the BBC to pursue electronic music and founded her own studio.',

  'oscillator': 'A device that produces a repeating wave of sound. Think of it as the basic voice or tone generator. Multiple oscillators at different pitches create harmony or texture.',

  'audio filter': 'A tool that lets certain frequencies through while blocking others. Like adjusting treble and bass on a stereo, but more precise and flexible.',

  'envelope': 'The shape of a sound over time—how it starts, holds, and fades. A piano has a sharp attack then fades. A violin can swell gradually.',

  'envelope filter': 'A filter that responds to how loud you play. Hit harder and the sound gets brighter. Play softer and it gets darker. It follows the dynamics of your performance.',

  'control voltage': 'A signal that controls other signals. Instead of making sound, it tells other modules what to do—like using one knob to automatically adjust several others.',

  'wdr': 'West German Radio (Westdeutscher Rundfunk). Their electronic music studio in Cologne became a legendary place where composers experimented with tape and early synthesizers.',

  'spectrogram': 'A visual representation of sound that shows which frequencies are present over time. It lets you see what you hear—like reading sheet music, but for the actual sound waves.',

  'amplitude': 'The loudness or intensity of a signal. Higher amplitude means louder sound, lower means quieter. It is the height of the wave.',

  'lan': 'Local Area Network. A way to connect computers together in the same physical space using cables, so they can share data directly without the internet.',

  'ethernet': 'The type of cable and connection standard used to link computers in a network. The physical cable that carries data between machines.',

  'switch': 'A box with multiple ethernet ports that lets many devices connect to the same network. It routes data between all the connected machines.',

  'audio interface': 'Hardware that converts digital signals from a computer into analog sound you can hear through speakers, and vice versa. The bridge between computer and audio world.',

  'equalizer': 'A tool for adjusting the balance of different frequencies in a sound. You can boost or reduce bass, midrange, or treble to shape how something sounds in a room.',
