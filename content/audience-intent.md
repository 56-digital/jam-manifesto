# Audience & Intent — Answered

---

## The Reader (three people, one piece)

**Primary:** Partners, collaborators, people Timur is showing this to.
They should feel the energy and passion — even if they don't get every reference.
They should read through and think: "I understand what he's describing."

**Secondary:** Musical people with some technical awareness.
They should finish reading and think: "This is so fucking sick. How can I try this?"

**Tertiary:** The agency / workshop partner already in conversation.
They should see the vision clearly enough to say: "Yes. Let's build this. Give me the space."

**Assumed knowledge:** Knows what a DAW is. Familiar with agents to some extent. Does NOT need to know what a bus or LFO is. Not a coder. Just someone who makes or thinks about music.

**Reference point:** Ryoji Ikeda — presents motivation and feeling first, technical drawings near the end. Both coexist. One doesn't cancel the other.

## What They Should Feel After Reading

"This needs to be made."
"I wish this existed."
"Does this exist? Can I try it?"

Not a CTA. Not a repo link. Not a signup form.

**Emptiness is co-creation.** Leave space for the reader to project their own vision onto it.
Someone should finish and feel so inspired they start thinking about their own creative process — how this could change how THEY work.

## What This Document Is

A vision document. A creative manifesto. An interactive artifact.
Part pitch deck (for the agency partner) — show what it will feel like when it's good.
Part archive of a creative process in motion.

**Not a product.** Not a finished system. Not yet.

## The Honest State of Things

It has worked. Timur ran a session:
> "I said: add this beat, add an offset, open the filter, add a delay, turn down the delay. It worked. It was actually really fun."

But it's not production-ready or battle-tested.
The workshop hasn't happened.
The system has no name yet.
The pieces exist — SuperCollider + Python/Go interface + WebSockets + LAN — but it's not fully built.

**That honesty belongs in the piece.** It's more compelling than a polished product demo.

## Tone

Personal. Passionate. With space.
Not technical jargon in the prose — but technical drawings exist at the end for those who follow.
Like Ikeda: the data IS the art, but you don't lead with the data.
Short paragraphs. White space. Things left unsaid on purpose.
