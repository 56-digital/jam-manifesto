# Workshop Notes — Raw (Timur, Feb 2026)

---

## General Concept

- Agentic, OpenClaw-style networked local music making
- 3-day workshop
- Everyone's devices interconnected via LAN switch + Ethernet cables to one central computer connected to speakers
- Control flow: participants send/control signals to main computer → processes/plays sound
- Monolithic sculpture in the center: server rack with EQ for speakers, in/out for computer, mounted computer bus, speakers, Ethernet switch with long cables snaking out to participants
- Instant changes/requests because everything runs over local network

---

## Day One

- Introduce the concept + short demonstration
- Work with people to pick it apart, get a sense of it (everyone comes from different music/performance backgrounds)
- Check knowledge level: sequencers, frequencies, patterns, rhythms etc.
- Introduce basic primitives of how the thing works + show what "interconnected" means
- Walk through the whole stack
- Break-in: set up everyone's IPs, soundcheck, test demo, connect each control panel, sniff through the network
- Familiarizing: initial setup, testing sound, intro to electronic music, sound design, shaping, performance, this network setup
- Goal coming out: thinking about how they could start designing/installing agents (if not ready, that's fine — a lot for day 1) + making a beat (simple tracks, multiple sequences on top of each other to a master clock)

## Day Two

- Come back after sleeping on it: they've run a local instance, tested it out, started playing more advanced notes, saving, maybe building features, creating their own plugins
- Low rehearsal jam session
- Everyone plugged in
- Little showcase: people present music, tracks, vibes they've made + any nuances/issues/workflows:
  - "This worked really well"
  - "Agent died here"
  - "Found a model that worked better"
  - "Adjusted the system prompt"
  - "Built this little thing"
- Peer-to-peer knowledge transfer

---

## Day Three

- Performance: all plugged in, not high pressure
- Full jam session (drum-circle style) — people playing, tweaking
- Recording the whole thing in the background
- Bit of a spectacle: everyone's laptops and devices arranged in the space
- The sculpture/monolith at the center, cables radiating out

---

## Key Aesthetic / Feeling

- Drum circle but electronic
- LAN party but musical
- Not a class — a session
- The building of tools IS part of the performance
- The network IS the instrument
